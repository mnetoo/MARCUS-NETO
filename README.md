I am a Biomedical Informatic student with a strong foundation in web development and desktop applications, working on both backend and frontend.
Over the past year, I have gained practical experience with several programming languages, including Pascal, C, C++, and C#.
I have applied object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to develop scalable, well-structured solutions that meet real-world demands.

My journey in software development is marked by a passion for problem-solving and continuous learning.I have developed and contributed to projects ranging
from algorithmic challenges to complete software solutions, refining my skills in system architecture, database management, and software optimization.
I enjoy working on projects that push me to explore new technologies and implement efficient, maintainable code.

In addition to programming, I have experience with web development, designing and implementing dynamic, responsive interfaces. I am proficient in both
frontend and backend technologies, allowing me to build full-stack applications. Currently, I am working as an intern, where I apply my technical skills
in a professional environment, learning from industry experts and refining my ability to develop robust applications. I am always looking for ways to
enhance my expertise, exploring frameworks, tools, and best practices to stay up to date with the latest trends in software engineering.

Today I work at the Center for Applied Research in Geoinformation (CEPAG) at the Federal University of Paraná, Centro Politécnico, participating in several
projects for the university itself and for private companies, which range from Desktop, Mobile and Web development. I have contact with several professionals in
each area and we all work together thinking about the best solutions for each type of problem.

Passionate about innovation and technology, I am dedicated to continuous growth, always eager to take on new challenges and contribute meaningful solutions.
My goal is to become a highly skilled software developer, capable of designing and implementing cutting-edge applications that make a difference.
